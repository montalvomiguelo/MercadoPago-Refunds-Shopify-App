## Development
Install the app dependencies and start the app

```
bundle install
npm install
rackup
```

The embedded app sdk won't load non https content so you'll need to use a forwarding service like ngrok or forwardhq. Set your application url in the Shopify Partner area to your forwarded url. However The redirect_uri should still be http://localhost:9292/auth/shopify/callback which will allow you to install your app on a live shop while running it locally.

## Test
Running the tests

## Development
Install the app dependencies

```
bundle install
npm install
```

Run the migrations

```
sequel -m db/migrate sqlite://db/development.sqlite3
```

Set env variables in .env file

```
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=23jordan
SHOPIFY_SHARED_SECRET=23jordan
DATABASE_URL='sqlite://db/development.sqlite3'
SECRET='This is a key that is 256 bits!!'
```

Start the app

```
rackup
```

The embedded app sdk won't load non https content so you'll need to use a forwarding service like ngrok or forwardhq. Set your application url in the Shopify Partner area to your forwarded url. However The redirect_uri should still be http://localhost:9292/auth/shopify/callback which will allow you to install your app on a live shop while running it locally.

## Test
Running the tests
